# Unemployment-Analysis-with-Python-Unemployment-CodeAlpha_Project
In this project, I used Python to analyze unemployment data across various regions. By loading the dataset with pandas, I explored the data structure and key variables such as region names and unemployment rates. I then created visualizations using Plotly Express, including bar graphs to compare unemployment levels across states, box plots to examine the distribution and variation within regions, scatter plots to identify outliers, and histograms to observe overall distribution patterns. These visual tools helped me uncover trends, identify regions with higher or lower unemployment, and better understand the overall employment scenario. Overall, Python enabled efficient data processing and clear visualization, making complex unemployment data easier to interpret and analyze.
